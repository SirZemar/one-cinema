<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p><description>My first real project where I could tackle the exciting React library as well apply basic knowledge of typescript.</description></p>
<p> 
  The environment was set up with create-react-app. All react code is functional component-based, which I find that using hooks does my code look cleaner and more compact.
  I use TMDB API where I fetch the movies data. The login feature has its data received by context, as for other components, they all get from parent to child props.
